# Custom Shaders for OBS

[Inspired by FiniteSingularity](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/advanced-effects-for-live-streaming), I want to make a mess in OBS for my streams. I'll keep the custom shaders I write here.

## NOTE: I truly have no idea what I’m doing.

Like, for realsies.

## Resources

- I’m using [obs-shaderfilter](https://github.com/exeldro/obs-shaderfilter) to load the shaders into OBS as filters
